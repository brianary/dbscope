DBScope is a tool to inspect databases and data.

  * Connect to any database that has a .NET connection provider.
  * Build and save connection strings.
  * View a connection's provider information, reserved words, and data types.
  * Query a database directly, and view any row verically.
  * View the columns of a table, as well as the table's data (or just sample data), and view any row vertically.
  * Access the details and statistical analysis of any column.
  * Customize any SQL statement used by DBScope to suit your needs, or adapt to any idiosyncratic SQL syntax by simply altering the .config file.
  * Determine the type of data stored in binary columns by [magic number](http://code.google.com/p/magicnumber-lite/).
